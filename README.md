# D&D Tracker
## Inspiration
Being a fitness enthusiast myself, the nutritional aspect of lifestyle fascinates me. But the lack of proper information and not finding them at one place has inspired me to create a website which would help you identify your diseases or deficiency according to the symptoms you are experiencing along with the list of cure and doctors whom you can consult.
